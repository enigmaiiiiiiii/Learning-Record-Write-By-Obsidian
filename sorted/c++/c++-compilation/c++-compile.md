# C++ - Compilation

## What Is Source File

- Source file naming conventions: Different compilers have different suffix naming conventions. Common suffixes include **.cc, .cxx, .cpp, .cp, .C**.

## What is Linker

- [Object files](c-object-file.md) contain only machine code translated by the compiler from the code you wrote.
- [Executable files](executable-file.md) also contain machine code for library functions and startup code used in your program.
- Combining object code, system-standard startup code, and [library files](c-library-file.md) into a single file results in an [executable file](executable-file.md).
- [GNU linker - command ld](gnu-linker.md)

## common c++ compilers

- [GCC](gcc.md)
- MSVC
- clang
