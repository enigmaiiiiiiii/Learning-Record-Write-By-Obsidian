## Euclidean Geometry 

- normally high school knowledge, points, lines, planes, angles, triangles, circles, polygons, polyhedra, etc.

## Non-Euclidean Geometry

- when talk about non-euclidean geometry, generally talk about in **curved space**
- in curve space, the sum of angles of a triangle is not 180Â°, two parallel lines can intersect, etc.
