## What Problem Does Typescript Solve

- JavaScript is hard to predict what code will do **before it runs**
- Spell check

## What Static Type Language Should Be

- Type is concept of describing which values can be passed to and which will crash
- Static type has to make the call over what code should be **flagged as an error**

## Complile Typescript

- Typescript aren't part of JavaScript(or ECMAScript to be pedantic)
- So there aren't any browsers or other runtimes that can just run TypeScript unmodified
- Type annotations are completely erased during compilation

## What Typescript Does

- Providing type checking
- Providing [more strict checking level](typescript-config-file.md), the higher the level, the more typescript will check
