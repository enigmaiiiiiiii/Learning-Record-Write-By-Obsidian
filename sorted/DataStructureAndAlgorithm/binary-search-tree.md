# binary search tree

- ordered tree
- left subtree < root

> if left subtree is not empty, then all nodes in left subtree are less than root

- right subtree > root

> if right subtree is not empty, then all nodes in right subtree are greater than root

- left and right subtree are also binary search tree
- inorder traverse on binary search tree, get a **sorted*e array
