# Computer Graphics

## Vertex

- a point in 3D space
- represents a specific postion on an object **surface**
- defined by coordinates `(x, y, z)`
- vertices is plural of vertex

## mesh

- mesh is a collectoin of vertices, edges and faces

## UV mapping

- a process of projecting(转换/投影) 2D image onto a 3D model's surface
- U, V denote X, Y
- helps to apply textures to 3D models

## Orthographic projection

- all object shown at the **same scale**, **regardless of distance**
- can **accurately** represent object's **size** and **shape**
- suitable for **2D** game art, and **architectural** and **drawing** design

## Perspective projection

- mimic the way the **human eye** sees
- suitable for **realistic** and **natural-looking** rendering

## Viewing Frustum(视锥体)

## alpha test

- a technique to **reduce** the number of **pixels** that need to be **rendered**
- use pixels alpha value to determine whether to render it or not
- which can avoiding the performance overhead, for example
  - leaves on a tree
  - window on a building
