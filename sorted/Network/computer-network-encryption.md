# encryption

- transform plaintext data into ciphertext
- used to protect protect data confidentiality
- only be decrypeted with appropriate **decryption key**

two types of encryption

- symmetric: same key used for both encryption and decryption
- asymmetric: different keys used for encryption and decryption

## encryption algorithms

- [RSA](computer-network-cryptographic-algorithms.md#rsa)
- ed25519
- AES
- Blowfish
- Triple DES
