# Computer Network - Asymmetric Key

## What It Is

## Key Pair

- consists of
  - [public key](#public-key)
  - [private key](#private-key)
- **anyone** with public key can encrypt a message
- **only those who** know the corresponding private key can decrypt the message
- generated with crptographic algorithms

## Public Key

- kind of [cryptographic key](computer-network-cryptographic-key.md)
- free to distribute

## Private Key

- kind of [cryptographic key](computer-network-cryptographic-key.md)
- must be kept secret

## Concrete demonstration

$3 \times 7 \times 17 \times 23 = 8211$

this is the process of

$8211 = ? \times ? \times ? \times ?$
