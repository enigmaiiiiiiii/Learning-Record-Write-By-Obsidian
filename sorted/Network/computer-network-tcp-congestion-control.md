# Computer Network - TCP Congestion Control

- lost packets trigger a reduction in data delivery rate
- SWND: Send Window
  - limit the number of TCP segments that can be sent without receiving an ACK
  - to small will cause network delay
  - to large will cause congestion
- SMSS: Sender Maximum Segment Size
- RWND: Receive Window
