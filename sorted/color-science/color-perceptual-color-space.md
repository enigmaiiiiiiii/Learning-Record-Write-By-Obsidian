# Coloe Science - Perceptual Color Space

## What is Perceptual Color Space

- Perceptual color space is a color space transformed from standard color space
- in ideal perceptual color space: all pairs separated by a "just noticeable difference" would be separated by an equal distance

> assume that "just noticeable difference" is a measurable constant, actually it's not
