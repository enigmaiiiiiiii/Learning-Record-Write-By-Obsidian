## Hue

[Color Hue](color-hue.md)

## Neutral color

- black, white, gray

## Visible Light

- light wavelength between 380nm to 780nm

## Spectral Color

classifications: wavelength from short to long

- violet
- blue
- green
- yellow
- orange
- red

## Tint

- mixture of a color with white

## Shade

- mixture of a color with black

## Tone

- mixture of a color with gray, or any [neutral color](#neutral-color)

## Color Depth

- Color Depth is measured in **bits** per pixel
- determine the range and precision of colors

what color depth describe

- A concept in digital imaging and computer graphics
- Describes the amount of information used to represent the colors in an image

detail

- 1 bit color depth: each pixel can only represent 2 colors, black and white
- 24 bits color depth: each pixel can represent 16777216 colors
- `#47aef0` is a 24-bit color

## Saturation/Chroma

## Luminance

## Chromaticity

- is an objective specification of the quality of a color
- regradless of its [luminance](#luminance)

## Luminous Efficacy

- eye responds differently to different wavelengths of light
- A 100-watt lightbulb
