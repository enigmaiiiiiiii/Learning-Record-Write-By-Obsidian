# Color Science - Fundamental Of Color

## What Is Color

- Color isn't exist in physical world
- Color is a subjective sensation
- One color can be mixed by various wavelength of lights

## Human Color Sensation

- for **three** types of cone cells in human eye, human color can be describe by three parameters

Spectral Sentivity

## Cone Cells

- responsible for color vision
- human eye has three types of cone cells, sentive to different [wavelength](color-glossary.md#spectral-color) of light
  - S-cones: sensitive to short wavelength(420-440nm)
  - M-cones: sensitive to medium-wavelength(530-540nm)
  - L-cones: sensitive to long-wavelength(560-580nm)

## Rod Cells 

- responsible for night vision
- more sensitive thant [cone cells](#cone-cells)
- play a little role in color vision
- that's why colors are much less apparent in dim light
