- turning image [grayscale](), keep lightness
- increase the [saturation](color-glossary.md#saturation/chroma) of colors
- maintaining percieved [hue](color-glossary.md#hue) and [lightness]()

## OkLab VS Lab

- [CIELAB](color-space.md#cielab-color-space) is bad at hue prediction

## Oklab VS HSV

## Convertion Between Oklab and sRGB
