## Match Single Character

use `[]` to match single character

- `[a-z]`: match the character from a to z
- `[a-z0-9]`: match the character from a to z and 0 to 9
- `[^abc]`: `^` in `[]`, represents not, match any character except a, b, c

> `^` outside `[]` represents line start
> you can not use `^` exclusion syntax and inclusion syntax in the same `[]`

## number of occurrences

- `+`: match the previous character/group 1 or more times, equivalent to `{1, }`
- `*`: match the previous character/group 0 or more times, equivalent to `{0, }`
- `{n}`: match the previous character/group `n` times
- `{n, m}`: match the previous character/group from `n` to `m` times
- `{n, }`: match the previous character/group at least `n` times
